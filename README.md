## To the solution reviewer:
- At the beginning of the project, I did few commits using the red-green-refactor approach to emphasize the TDD approach... but under normal circumstances I would never commit and push to remote repository uncompilable code
- At the final stage of creating the solution, I used AI support (creating Javadocs, enriching the changelog)
- I also considered additional validations (no possibility of playing two matches at the same time for one team, no possibility of decreasing the team's score (number of goals only up, never down)) but this was not mentioned in the specification
