## To the solution reviewer:
- At the beginning of the project, I did few commits using the red-green-refactor approach to emphasize the TDD approach... but under normal circumstances I would never commit and push to remote repository uncompilable code
- At the final stage of creating the solution, I used AI support (creating Javadocs, enriching the changelog)
